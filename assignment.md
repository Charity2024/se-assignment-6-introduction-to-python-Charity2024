## SE-Assignment-6: Introduction to Python

### Python Basics
**Python** is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and versatility. Its clean syntax and emphasis on code readability make it a popular choice for beginners and experienced developers alike.

**Key features** contributing to its popularity include:

* **Readability:** Python's code is often described as "pseudocode-like," making it easy to understand and write.
* **Interpreted:** No compilation is required, allowing for rapid development and testing.
* **Large standard library:** Offers modules for various tasks, from web development to data science.
* **Cross-platform compatibility:** Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, and more.
* **Object-oriented programming:** Supports object-oriented paradigms.

**Use cases:**

* **Web development:** Frameworks like Django and Flask.
* **Data science and machine learning:** Libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.
* **Scripting and automation:** For system administration tasks and automating repetitive processes.
* **Game development:** Using libraries like Pygame.
* **Educational purposes:** Its simplicity makes it ideal for teaching programming concepts.

### Installing Python
**Steps:**

1. **Download:** Visit [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the appropriate installer for your operating system.
2. **Installation:** Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions. Ensure you check the option to add Python to the PATH environment variable.
3. **Verification:** Open a terminal or command prompt and type `python --version` or `python3 --version`. A successful installation will display the Python version.

**Setting up a virtual environment:**

* **Install `venv`:** Ensure the `venv` module is installed: `pip install venv`
* **Create a virtual environment:** `python -m venv myenv` (replace `myenv` with your desired environment name)
* **Activate the environment:**
  * Windows: `myenv\Scripts\activate`
  * macOS/Linux: `source myenv/bin/activate`

### Python Syntax and Semantics
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
* `print` is a built-in function to display output.
* `"Hello, World!"` is a string enclosed in quotes.

### Data Types and Variables
Python's basic data types include:

* **Numbers:** Integers (e.g., 42), floating-point numbers (e.g., 3.14), complex numbers (e.g., 2+3j).
* **Strings:** Textual data enclosed in quotes (e.g., "Hello").
* **Boolean:** True or False values.
* **None:** Represents no value or null.

```python
x = 10  # Integer
y = 3.14  # Float
name = "Alice"  # String
is_valid = True  # Boolean
```

### Control Structures
* **Conditional statements:** `if`, `else`, `elif`
```python
if x > 0:
    print("x is positive")
else:
    print("x is non-positive")
```
* **Loops:** `for`, `while`
```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

### Functions in Python
Functions are reusable blocks of code.
```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(3, 5)
print(result)  # Output: 8
```

### Lists and Dictionaries
* **Lists:** Ordered collections of items.
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
* **Dictionaries:** Unordered collections of key-value pairs.
```python
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
```

### Exception Handling
Exception handling prevents program crashes.
```python
try:
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    result = 10 / num
    print(result)
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Division by zero error.")
finally:
    print("This block always executes.")
```

### Modules and Packages
* **Modules:** Python files containing functions, classes, and variables.
* **Packages:** Collections of modules organized in directories.
```python
import math

result = math.sqrt(16)
print(result)  # Output: 4.0
```

### File I/O
* **Reading:**
```python
with open("data.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```
* **Writing:**
```python
data = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
with open("output.txt", "w") as file:
    for item in data:
        file.write(item + "\n")
```

**Note:** This is a basic overview. Python offers much more depth and features. For further exploration, consult official Python documentation and tutorials.
 
**Remember to replace placeholders like `data.txt` and `output.txt` with actual file paths.**
